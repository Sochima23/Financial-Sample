# Financial Sample
## Introduction
The goal of this analysis is to practise my newly learnt PowerBi skills

## Problem Statement
Our manager wants to see a report on the latest sales figures. They've requested an executive summary of:

*Which month and year had the most profit?
*Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?
*Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

This is the [excel file](https://github.com/Sochima23/Financial-Sample/blob/main/Financial%20Sample.xlsx)

## Data Transformation
Data cleaning was performed with power bi. The column named Month Name was changed to 'Month'. Furthermore, the column named 'units sold' was changed from decimal type to whole number. I also changed United States of America to 'USA' in the country column to avoid the long name. Apart from these, the dataset appeared to be clean. The quality of each column was 100% with no error or nulls. Below is a preview of the table:
